Dodge the virus game code

# README for my-app #

My program is a game app using Javascript. The purpose of the game is to dodge the viruses and prevent your precious files and data from the virus, “bugs” that are moving around the game screen to eventually find a way to get into your memory of your computer and corrupt it. Your goal is to save your information from getting corrupted. The game app shows a laptop, bugs (symbolizes viruses), folder image, user image and a truck that shows the level number over it. In the middle of the game, I use a virus protection boost (SHIFT KEY) to give me a bonus to speed up and go faster. Also, the other images on the screen act as obstacles that signify that the virus can corrupt those files of the user. After the user touches the virus three times the lives goes down and it takes you to the next screen which is the gameOver screen, here you can view your recent scores and also the actual score of the player.  Also, this game can also be played in a touchscreen device like a phone or tablet, just click on the screen to get the controls.
